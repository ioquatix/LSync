Backup Scripts list a set of servers and directories.

A server is a logical unit where files are available or stored.

Directories are specific places within servers.

A backup will stop at any point if there is a failure. This indicates that the entire backup failed.


-- TODO --
Link Backup might fail if the file changes when the catalog is being updated - need to talk to Scott about it.
